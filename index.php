    <p class="text-fit">The Maple Hill Yacht Club was founded in 1935 based on the principles of sailing and friendship which are the cornerstones on which the club operates today. MHYC is a private club and is 100% owned and operated by its members. MHYC sponsors many boating and social events throughout the summer season. The club also hosts and operates a junior sailing program that runs for eight weeks during the summer season. The Junior program is taught by US Sailing level One certified instructors and is a highlight of the club for members and their children alike.</p>
