We are looking for eager hands to help clean up downed sticks from winter as well as spreading crushed rock around the junior sailing boat ramp. There will be coffee and donuts provided. Come out and help get the facility looking good for the coming season!</p>

                    The MHYC is shooting for 40 boats at this year’s event. All sailors have the opportunity to get directly involved & raise money to cure cancer. This event will start with an island race in the morning and be followed by a live auction and cook out at the club. Please distribute this to all your sailing friends to inform and access all potential competitors. The more fundraisers, the more money and awareness for The American Cancer Society!
